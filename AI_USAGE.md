Critique of AI
The AI struggles with software-specific queries, often confusing the features and tools of one 
program with another. It lacks a nuanced understanding of the differences between various software 
packages.
Furthermore, when tasked with complex circuit analysis, the AI's grasp of fundamental principles 
can be unreliable. It has a tendency to provide incorrect or fabricated answers rather than 
admitting the limitations of its knowledge in specialized topics.
